# Road Accident Casualties Data Analysis
## Summary
This project aims to analyze road accident casualties data to gain insights into the factors contributing to accidents and their severity using Microsoft Excel. The data is sourced from Kaggle and includes various attributes such as accident date, day of the week, junction control, accident severity, weather conditions, and more.

## Project Overview
The project involves cleaning and transforming the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, creating new features such as month and year from the accident date, and correcting any typos or inconsistencies in the data.

Following data preparation, the analysis focuses on identifying patterns and trends related to road accidents. Key performance indicators such as the count of fatal, serious, and slight casualties are examined, along with insights into the most common types of vehicles involved in accidents. Additionally, visualizations are created to explore the distribution of casualties by various factors such as month, road surface conditions, and urban or rural areas.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from Kaggle: [Road Accident Analysis Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityavamajumder/road-accident-analysis-data)

## Cleaning and Transformation
- Checked for empty cells in all columns and replaced them using find and replace.
- Added new columns for month and year extracted from the accident date to facilitate visualization.
- Ensured correct spellings in all columns and replaced typos, such as correcting "fetal" to "fatal" in the accident severity column.

## Data Analysis
The analysis includes:

- Key performance indicators: Fatal casualties count, serious casualties count, and slight casualties count.
- Most common vehicle types involved in accidents.
- Distribution of casualties month-wise for each year.
- Analysis of casualties by road surface conditions.
- Examination of casualties in urban and rural areas.

## Findings
- The total number of casualties in the dataset is 417,883.
- Slight casualties account for the majority of casualties, comprising 84.1% of all casualties.
- The most common type of vehicle involved in accidents is cars, accounting for 333,485 casualties, which represents 79.8% of all casualties.
- The majority of casualties occur in urban areas.
- Daytime accidents are more prevalent compared to nighttime accidents.
- Accidents predominantly occur on dry road surfaces, with 279,445 casualties recorded in such conditions.
